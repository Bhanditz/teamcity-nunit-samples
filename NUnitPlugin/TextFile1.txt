See https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Engine-Extensibility to implement extensions.

To activate extension you should copy your extension's assembly and its dependencies to the "addins" directory.
Also you should add the appropriate entry the file "nunit.engine.addins" or you should create your own file with extension ".addins" with reference to your plugin's assembly.
